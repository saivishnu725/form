## 1. Plan
<pre>
The plan is to create three different repositories/folders (idk lets see.. i do want to learn submodules) inside this repository for 
    a. <i>HTML</i>
    b. <i>CSS</i> added to <b>a)</b>
    c. complete revamp of <b>b)</b> with <i>JS</i> to make it use custom questions and input types and stuff
    d. another complete revamp to make it look and work like <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/" style="decoration:none;color:inherit">Google Forms. </a>
</pre>
